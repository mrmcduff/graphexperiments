# graphexperiments
This project exists to be an easy way to play with Time Series elements from react-vis, without having to worry about a larger framework or any real data.

The graphs are noisy (just randomly generated), and they are displayed inside a single div, stacked vertically. Editing the code is needed for changing what they look like, but you can run the program locally by using `yarn start` in the `graphix` folder, and hot loading will update things quickly.

This project uses `create react-app --typescript`, so customization of the `package.json` scripts are limited.
